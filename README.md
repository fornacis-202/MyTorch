# MyTorch

MyTorch is my custom-implemented deep learning framework inspired by PyTorch. Its a simplified version of pytroch implemented everything from scratch using numpy. Using this framework, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the MNIST dataset is developed.
